    The Renaissance was a time period in European history from the 14th-16th century.
    The word "Renaissance" is "Rebirth" meaning that the renaissance was a time of wisdom and learning. The spirt of the Renaissance took many forms but was expressed by an intellectual movemnet called Humanism, Humanism was initiated by secular men of letters rather than those who had dominated the medieval intellectual life and developed the Scholastic philosophy. Humanism began in Italy by Dante and Petrarch, and its chief protagonists included Giannozzo  Manetti, Leonardo Bruni, Marsilio Ficino, Giovanni Pico Della Mirandola, Lorenzo Valla, and Coluccio Saluti. When the fall of Constantinople happened in 1453, Humanism provided a major boostn for many eastern scholars. They all fled to Italy bringing books and manuscripts and traditonal Greek scholarships.
    Humanism inspired and brought confidence to men to help them feel free and create new possibilities.
    From Italy the humanism spirt and the Renaissance spread all across Europe with the invention of the mechanized printing press, which allowed classical texts and literacy to grow. The intellectual simulation provided by humanist helped spark the reformation for many humanist including erasmus, by the end of the 16th century the battle of reformation and counter-reformation had much of Europe's energy and attention. It was art that the spirt of the renaissance achieved the sharpest formulation, art became the branch of knowledge and provided people with images of God and his creations as well as insights into humankind position in the universe. Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings were seen as science. Art was based on the observation of the visible world and practiced according to mathematical priniciples of balance, harmony, and perspective.
